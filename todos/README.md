<h2>methods used to make elements</h2>
1. document.createElement() : 
  <br>what is the difference between .createElements()?
  <br>can I say "variable(declared before).createElement()", just like we can point out DOM?
2. .appendChild()
  <br>append child elements. always appends at the last order
3. using target
  <br> it is possible to use event.target without event delegation. just add eventlisner on the specific element that will be clicked or made to have other events

<h2>methods used to make elements</h2>
<p><h3>1. document.createElement()</h3>
  <br>what is the difference between .createElements()?
  <br>can I say "variable(declared before).createElement()", just like we can point out DOM?</p>
<p><h3>2. .appendChild()</h3>
  <br>append child elements. always appends at the last order</p>
<p><h3>3. using target</h3>
  <br> it is possible to use event.target without event delegation. just add eventlisner on the specific element that will be clicked or made to have other events</p>
